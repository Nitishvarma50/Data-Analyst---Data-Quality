        "Matillion, the leading cloud data integration platform, today announced $100M in Series D funding, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with participation from Battery Ventures, Sapphire Ventures, Scale Venture Partners with financing from Silicon Valley Bank UK Branch*. The funding will fuel the company's growth, as it meets exploding demand for cloud data integration for global enterprise organizations such as Amazon, Siemens, Subway, Novartis, Slack, and Accenture. Matillion solves a key challenge for the enterprise, helping them overcome the struggle to capture and innovate with data to quickly unlock the insights they need. A recent MarketPulse survey by IDG and Matillion found data teams spend nearly half their time preparing data for analytics. Matillion's cloud-native platform enables enterprise organizations to transform raw data into the refined, analytics-ready data required to support business intelligence, visualization, artificial intelligence and machine learning. We're proud to lead Matillion's Series D and partner with Matthew and his team as they continue to scale and deliver rapid returns on cloud investments for global enterprises.\" Matillion was recognized in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Integration Tools and named a Top Rated Data Integration Tool in 2020 for the second year in a row by TrustRadius, based on unbiased customers' user satisfaction scores. In 2020, it increased the investment in enterprise product and engineering, extended support for the Snowflake user community with Matillion ETL and Matillion Data Loader on Partner Connect, and launched Matillion ETL for Azure Synapse, and Matillion ETL for Databricks.": 4,
        "The business of platforms for developing websites and publishing online is a crowded one, with established players like WordPress, Wix, Zoho, Weebly, Duda Mobile and Squarespace competing against newer entrants like Medium and the likes of LinkedIn. Now make way for another one: Universe, a startup that hopes its mobile-first approach for building \u201clight\u201d websites on mobile \u2014 the pitch is that these can be built in \u201cunder a minute\u201d \u2014 can give it a unique foothold in the market. Universe, which is based out of Brooklyn, New York, is today launching its first app, for iOS, with $3.2 million in funding from General Catalyst, Greylock Partners (from its development and seed fund), Eniac Ventures and led by Box Group. Universe founder Joseph Cohen said that he envisions Universe sites to be the kind of thing you might find linked on an Instagram profile page. \u201cMillennials are not using the Squarespaces of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cOur intent is to let you be creative in a whole new way.\u201d Sites tacked to Universe\u2019s own domain are free, while those registered with custom domains start at a competitive $2.99/month. Cohen tells me that the idea to build Universe first came to him three years ago after he sold his previous startup, education-tech company Lore, to Noodle Education. (Cohen himself dropped out of U Penn in his sophomore year and never went back). \u201cI\u2019ve been obsessed with this space for three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt comes from the desire to turn phones into creative devices. The web is still this incredible platform for sharing identities, and there needs to be a mobile-native way for creating for the web.\u201d Universe tackles the balance between creativity and templates to speed things up with a slick interface that presents the real estate of the phone as a 3\u00d75 area, where you can select a background and then start to add text, photos, videos and link modules through a drag and drop interface. Indeed, the intention is not to give serious developers or large organizations one more way to build complex sites with large backends and processes behind them. At launch there isn\u2019t even a module to incorporate purchases \u2014 although this is likely to come in an update, Cohen tells me, along with other features. Nor are there any plans to extend this into a quick native app builder. \u201cWe\u2019ve thought long and hard about apps and explored prototypes,\u201d he said, before coming to the conclusion that \u201cnot everyone should have their own apps. It\u2019s hard to get apps distributed and as a casual user you shouldn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d Instead, the intention is to provide a way of creating simple web-based presences, which could be viral-ready widgets in themselves (think of sites like IsThisForThat or Is the L Train running?) or landing pages for more details about something like an event you\u2019re organizing for yourself. In a way, Universe feels less in the vein of services like Wix or Squarespace and more like other web-based tools that have been built to make other small things on the web that might go viral, like GIF creators or the now-defunct Checkthis (from the same people who then created Frontback). \u201cAbout.me is also too desktop focused,\u201d Cohen countered to my question about the once-AOL-owned online Yellow Pages. Cohen said that a lightbulb went off when he realized that the range of website builders that exist today approach the concept in a very constrained way that is just \u201cnot casual enough.\u201d Notably, Cohen himself doesn\u2019t come from a technical/developer background, which also likely had an influence in how Universe tackled building tech for non-tech people. His investors like to highlight the non-tech element here, too. Josh Elman of Greylock noted that Cohen\u2019s mother has designed event websites using the app, too. \u201cThe most transformative companies change the way we communicate and create,\u201d another investor, Spencer Lazar, partner at General Catalyst, said in a statement. \u201cWith its playful building-block interface, Universe transforms the slow, esoteric process of web design into a simple, creative mobile experience.\u201d While Universe sites are desktop-friendly, there are no plans to develop a desktop version of the builder. \u201cI really think that we can go very far with mobile,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cMy feeling is that the phone has so much creative potential as a tool. I think that a lot more of the web is going to be consumed and created on mobile.\u201d": 4,
